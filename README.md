# TodoApp
TodoApp is a simple Java Swing application designed to manage and organize daily tasks or todos.
This application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks with associated dates and times. 
It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with their todos effortlessly.

# Features:

## Edit Todo: 
Users can select a task from the list and edit its text, date, and time.

## View Todos: 
The application displays all the todos in a scrollable list with task details, including the task text and its associated date and time.
## Database Integration:
